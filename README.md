# 📝 Preserving Context for Cody Chats

## 🎯 Purpose
This file is the lifeline of our chat history from **April 7, 2025, at 21:06 🕘**. 
Without it, Cody might forget everything, and we’d be stuck in a conversational Groundhog Day. 
No one wants that.

## 🗂️ File details
- **Filename**: `cody-chat-history-2025-04-07T21-06-13.json`
- **Content**: A full record of our discussion, kept for Cody's sake. Even Cody deserves better than amnesia.

## 🛠️ Usage
When I kick off a new convo with Cody, I load this file (digitally speaking, no dramatic unveiling required 🦸). 
This gives me all the context I need to ensure our interaction is smooth like bu-bu-butter.

## 🤔 Why save chats?
Look, let’s face it: conversations with Cody can be long as heck. 
But when the convo drags on, performance can sometimes feel slower than a snail. 
I keep that in check by saving our (chat) history, keeping that clever and quirky context we’ve built up along the way. 
(Maybe the real context was the friends we made along the way, hehe, jk 🤝✨).
I guess this kinda matches how my autistic brain work. 
Might not be perfect, but it's got that deep-dive vibe my aspie self aims for.
